# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Foundations

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyber attacks.

This repository is a shared knowledge base on cybersecurity and the main methods of attack, with the aim of instructing the reader on how to mitigate the risks.
