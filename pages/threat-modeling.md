# ‚ôüÔ∏è Threat Modeling

It is a systematic approach to identifying, prioritising and addressing potential security threats across the organization, simulating possible attack scenarios and assessing the existing vulnerabilities of the existing systems and applications.

> Threat Modeling aims to reduce an organization‚Äôs overall risk exposure by identifying vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors, allowing for adequate security controls and strategies.

## üìù Building a Threat Modeling Report

To build a comprehensive Threat Modeling report, follow these steps:

1. **Scope Definition:** Clearly define the scope of the Threat Modeling exercise, including the systems, applications, and assets to be assessed.
2. **Asset Identification:** Identify the critical assets and data that need protection. This includes sensitive customer information, intellectual property, and key infrastructure components.
3. **Threat Identification:** Identify potential threats and attack vectors that could exploit vulnerabilities in the system. This can include external threats like hackers, as well as internal threats like disgruntled employees.
4. **Vulnerability Assessment:** Assess the existing vulnerabilities in the system. This can be done through security assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews.
5. **Risk Prioritization:** Prioritize the identified threats based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This helps in focusing resources on addressing the most critical risks.
6. **Security Controls:** Recommend and implement appropriate security controls to mitigate the identified risks. This can include implementing access controls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems.
7. **Report Documentation:** Document all the findings, recommendations, and actions taken in a comprehensive Threat Modeling report. This report should be easily understandable by stakeholders and provide clear guidance on improving the security posture.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat Modeling Diagram

A Threat Modeling diagram visually represents the various components of a system and the potential threats and vulnerabilities associated with each component. It helps in understanding the attack surface and identifying potential risks.

The diagram typically includes the following elements:

- **System Components:** Represented as boxes or nodes, these components can include servers, databases, APIs, user interfaces, and network infrastructure.
- **Data Flow:** Arrows or lines indicate the flow of data between system components. This helps in identifying potential points of data exposure or interception.
- **Threats:** Represented as icons or symbols, threats are associated with specific system components or data flows. These can include external threats like hackers, as well as internal threats like unauthorized access.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Represented as icons or symbols, vulnerabilities are associated with specific system components or data flows. These can include weak authentication mechanisms, lack of encryption, or insecure coding practices.

By visually mapping out the system components, data flows, threats, and vulnerabilities, a Threat Modeling diagram provides a holistic view of the security posture and aids in making informed decisions regarding risk mitigation.
