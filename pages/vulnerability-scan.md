# üéØ Vulnerability Scan

A vulnerability scan is a systematic process of identifying security vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, or application. It helps organizations identify and prioritize potential weaknesses, allowing them to proactively address these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

## üõ°Ô∏è Nessus

Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanning tool developed by Tenable. It is known for its comprehensive coverage and extensive vulnerability database. Some key features of Nessus include:
